# SubiektGT AD CommandTimeout Helper

> An interactive PowerShell utility for Active Directory administrators to quickly look up users, view the `Command Timeout` setting for InsERT Subiekt GT, and either navigate to or modify the value in the registry.

This tool is designed to solve a specific, recurring administrative task: checking and setting the `Command Timeout` registry value for users of Subiekt GT, directly referencing them via their Active Directory account.

## ‚ú® Features

* üîé **Interactive AD User Search:** Instantly lists all Active Directory users and allows for real-time filtering by Name, SamAccountName, or SID.
* üìà **Live Registry Data:** For each user in the filtered list, it queries the local machine's registry to display the current `Command Timeout` value, showing a `-` if it's not set.
* üîß **Action Menu:** After selecting a user by their index number, you can choose to:
    1.  **Open the Registry:** Instantly opens `regedit.exe` directly to the user's specific `Connection Properties` key.
    2.  **Set the Value:** Automatically creates or updates the `Command Timeout` DWORD value, setting it to `0`. The script handles the creation of the required keys if they don't exist.
* üöÄ **Self-Elevating:** The script automatically checks if it has administrator rights and will prompt for elevation if needed, ensuring it always has the permissions to perform registry operations.

## üöÄ Requirements

* Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
* **Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell** (This is part of the Remote Server Administration Tools - RSAT).
* **Administrator Privileges** (the script will prompt for elevation automatically).
* Network access to an Active Directory Domain Controller.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  Download the `Get-SubiektCommandTimeout.ps1` script to your machine.
2.  Right-click the file and choose **"Run with PowerShell"**.
3.  The script will request administrator privileges if it doesn't have them. Click **"Yes"** on the UAC prompt.
4.  The terminal will open and display a list of all users.
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts:
    * Type a filter (e.g., a user's last name) and press Enter to narrow down the list.
    * Type the index number of the user you want to manage and press Enter.
    * Choose an action from the menu (open registry or set value) and press Enter.

```powershell
# Example of running from an already-elevated PowerShell terminal
PS C:\Scripts> .\Get-SubiektCommandTimeout.ps1
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The registry path and value name are hardcoded within the script for convenience. If you need to target a different setting or a different version of the software, you can easily modify the variables in the `foreach` loop section of the script.

**Variables to change:**
* `$regQueryPath`: The full path to the registry key.
* `$valueName`: The name of the registry value to read.

```powershell
# Snippet from the script showing the configurable variables
$regQueryPath = "Registry::HKEY_USERS\$sid\Software\InsERT\InsERT GT\dbman\1.0\Connection Properties"
$valueName = "Command Timeout"
```
